# Repository Line Counts

Counts include tracked files under the repo root (excluding `.git/`). Documents cover Markdown, YAML/YML, TXT, and CSV files. Source code currently tracks Python files.

| Category | Lines |

| Source code (`.py`) | 1,170 |

> Generated on demand via a Python script that walks the repo and aggregates per-extension line counts.
