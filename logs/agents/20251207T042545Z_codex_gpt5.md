- Task: Implement the gap-penalized heuristic (weight=0.3), update reporting/selection order, include the full-feature baseline, and generate frontier plots for BRFSS.
- Key steps:
  1. Added `gap_penalty_weight` to the selection config, wired the `Val − 0.3 × gap` score into final-model selection and frontier primary selection, and stored the score in mode metadata.
  2. Enhanced the report to show mode rankings ordered by the penalty score, explicitly list the all-features baseline, and mention the generated plots; also created `frontier_curve.png` and `train_val_vs_features.png` from the frontier log.
  3. Re-ran `python -m fs_xgb.cli.main --config fs_xgb/experiments/configs/brfss_2015_frontier.yaml --results-dir results` (≈9 minutes) to regenerate outputs with the new heuristic/plots under `results/brfss_2015/20251207T042516Z`.
