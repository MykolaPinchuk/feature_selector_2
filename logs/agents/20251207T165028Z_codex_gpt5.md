- Task: Restore the BRFSS-style reporting structure (descriptions, runtime notes, overfit tables) and validate via a short Santander frontier run.
- Key steps:
  1. Reworked `fs_xgb/eval/reporting.py` to load optional feature descriptions, add runtime/cost context, richer SHAP/gain overfit tables, a “Top Kept Features” section, and description-aware full tables; ROC-AUC stayed in the performance table.
  2. Added `fs_xgb/experiments/configs/santander_customer_satisfaction_frontier_short.yaml` for quick sweeps (≤8 candidates) and re-ran it to produce `results/santander_customer_satisfaction/20251207T165018Z` with the new layout.
  3. Ran `pytest -q` to ensure the reporting changes didn’t break anything.
