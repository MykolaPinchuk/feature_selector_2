- Task: Execute the BRFSS diabetes frontier experiment with an expanded parameter grid and summarize the outputs.
- Key steps:
  1. Ran `python -m fs_xgb.cli.main --config fs_xgb/experiments/configs/brfss_2015_frontier.yaml --results-dir results` with a 60-minute timeout; the job finished in ~8.5 minutes.
  2. Verified that the run directory `results/brfss_2015/20251207T040307Z` contains metrics, feature lists, SHAP/gain/permutation tables, and `frontier_candidates.json` summarizing all evaluated combinations.
  3. Counted 432 evaluated parameter combos, with 24 unique feature sets retained before the max-candidate cap, yielding validation PR-AUC values ranging from 0.965 to 0.756 as feature counts shrink from 214 down to 1.
