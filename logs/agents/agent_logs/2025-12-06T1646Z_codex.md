- **Summary:**
  1. Added Markdown reporting utilities that summarize model metrics, feature-selection outcomes, and dataset EDA insights.
  2. Wired the pipeline to auto-generate per-run `report.md` files and a dataset-level `eda.md` whenever experiments execute.
  3. Re-ran the student_grades experiment twice to populate the new artifacts and verified the generated Markdown outputs.
  4. Updated documentation to describe the new reports and where they are stored.
