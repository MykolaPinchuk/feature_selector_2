- Task: BRFSS loader fixes (downsample, OOT splits, leakage audit)
- Summary:
  - Updated the BRFSS loader to parse interview timestamps, drop obvious diabetes-related leakage columns, and downsample negatives to a 50/50 class ratio; metadata now exposes a timestamp column for chronological splits.
  - Switched the BRFSS experiment configs to `splits.strategy: chronological` and clarified the README/roadmap docs.
  - Re-ran `brfss_2015_sample.yaml` producing `results/brfss_2015/20251207T024647Z`, which now shows more realistic PR-AUC (~0.95 val/test) without TE leakage (our encoder remains OOF even in naive mode).
