- Task: Kick off Iteration 4 by onboarding the Census Income dataset + EDA upgrades
- Summary:
  - Downloaded and inspected the Census Income KDD archive to confirm schema, target prevalence (~6%).
  - Added `fs_xgb/data/loaders/census_income.py` plus registry wiring, metadata, and configs (`census_income*.yaml`). Updated README/PRD/iteration plan with download + usage instructions.
  - Extended the EDA report generator with numeric-vs-target and pairwise correlation tables; all tests pass (`pytest`).
