- Task: Run naive-TE pipelines for student_grades and census_income_balanced
- Summary:
  - Executed the default config (student_grades) with the new naive target encoder, producing run directory `results/student_grades/20251207T021908Z`.
  - Ran the balanced Census Income config with naive TE, writing outputs to `results/census_income/20251207T021924Z`.
  - Captured metrics for both runs so we can compare how strongly the overfit encoder stresses the FS pipeline.
