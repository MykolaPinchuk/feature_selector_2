- Summary: Kicked off Iteration 3 by wiring a configurable SHAP-vs-permutation overfit filter into the FS pipeline, surfaced the knobs in docs/configs, and added tests/reporting so users can see which features were penalized.
- Key Steps:
  1. Updated `README.md`, `docs/iteration_plan.md`, and default/frontier configs to describe/enable the new `fs.overfit_filter` surface.
  2. Implemented `_flag_overfit_features`, extended `_apply_selection_rules`, and propagated the flagged list through mode metadata, reports, and `frontier_candidates.json`.
  3. Added `tests/` (with pytest + path shim) to cover the new heuristics and documented/validated the changes via `pytest`.
