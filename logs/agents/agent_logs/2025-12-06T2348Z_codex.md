- Task: Fix FS mode behavior + run frontier on balanced Census dataset
- Summary:
  - Mild mode was dropping too many features because `topk_shap=60` permuted the entire feature set, so even “rest” policies could not re-add columns. Reduced mild thresholds (also in default config), lowered `topk_shap` to 35, and retuned moderate thresholds so modes now keep progressively more features.
  - Re-ran the balanced Census profile config (`results/census_income/20251206T234726Z`) showing Aggressive=6, Moderate=11, Mild=14 features. Added a balanced frontier config and executed it to populate `frontier_candidates.json` under `results/census_income/20251206T234759Z` for more granular sweeps.
  - Updated README instructions to highlight the balanced frontier option.
