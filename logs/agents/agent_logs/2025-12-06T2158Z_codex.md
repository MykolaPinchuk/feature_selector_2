# Codex Run – 2025-12-06T2158Z
- Agent: Codex (GPT-5)
- Summary: Added configurable frontier-search mode that reuses SHAP/permutation artifacts, plus config/docs updates.
- Key Steps:
  1. Refactored FS logic to expose reusable SHAP/permutation artifacts and selection helpers.
  2. Implemented dual execution paths in `fs_xgb.pipeline`: legacy profile mode vs new frontier mode with grid sweeps, deduped feature sets, and candidate selection.
  3. Added configuration knobs (`fs_search`) with defaults, wrote README guidance, generated comprehensive candidate logs, and ran `python -m compileall fs_xgb` to sanity-check syntax.
