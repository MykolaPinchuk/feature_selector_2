- **Summary:**
  1. Read the PRD and interpreted the requirement to prioritize the Kaggle student grades dataset.
  2. Downloaded the mirrored dataset into `data/raw/` and added `.gitignore`/`pyproject` scaffolding.
  3. Created the `fs_xgb` package skeleton, dataset registry, loader for the student grades CSV, and random split utilities.
  4. Added experiment/default configs, dataset documentation, and usage instructions in `README.md`.
  5. Verified the loader + split logic with a Python smoke test.
