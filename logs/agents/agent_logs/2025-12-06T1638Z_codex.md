# Agent Run Log

- **Agent:** Codex (GPT-5)
- **Timestamp (UTC):** 2025-12-06T16:38:40Z
- **Summary:**
  1. Implemented end-to-end experiment pipeline (`fs_xgb/pipeline.py`) wired to dataset loaders, preprocessing, feature selection, and XGBoost models.
  2. Added metrics, model trainers, FS logic (SHAP triage + permutation FI), and CLI entry point for running experiments.
  3. Ensured results are persisted under `results/<dataset>/<timestamp>/` with metrics, FI tables, feature lists, and configs.
  4. Ran the pipeline on `student_grades` config to produce the first persisted analysis artifacts and updated README with run instructions.
