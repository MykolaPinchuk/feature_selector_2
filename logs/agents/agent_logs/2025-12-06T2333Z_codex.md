- Task: Balance Census Income dataset + update EDA target documentation
- Summary:
  - Added target-definition metadata to the Census loader and surfaced it in `eda.md` so the report explains how `is_high_income` is constructed.
  - Created `scripts/create_census_balanced_sample.py` to downsample the majority class (1:1 ratio) and generated `data/raw/census_income_kdd_balanced/`.
  - Added `census_income_balanced.yaml` config, documented the workflow in README/iteration plan, and ran the full pipeline on the balanced subset (results under `results/census_income/20251206T233258Z`).
  - All tests pass (`pytest`).
