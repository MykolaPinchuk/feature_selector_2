- Agent: Codex (GPT-5)
- Task: Iteration 5 kickoff – naive TE toggle
- Summary:
  - Added a `strategy` flag to `TargetEncodingConfig` so encoders can run in the original smoothed/thresholded mode or a new naive mode that uses raw category means.
  - Switched student-grades defaults plus all Census configs to `strategy="naive"` (smoothing/min thresholds off) to create intentionally overfit categorical columns for FS stress tests.
  - Documented the option in the README and marked the Iteration 5 roadmap item as completed for the existing datasets.
