# Codex Run – 2025-12-06T2252Z
- Agent: Codex (GPT-5)
- Summary: Added gain-vs-permutation overfit diagnostics + filtering alongside the existing SHAP logic, surfaced the results throughout configs/reporting/frontier logs, and validated via unit tests.
- Key Steps:
  1. Extended configs/docs (`README`, iteration plan, default/frontier YAML) with the new `fs.gain_overfit_filter` settings.
  2. Updated the FS pipeline to aggregate gain importance, flag gain-based mismatches, persist gain CSVs, and expose both SHAP/gain flags in metadata and reporting.
  3. Added pytest coverage for the new helper functions and reran the suite (`pytest`).
