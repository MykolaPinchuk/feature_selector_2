- Task: Back out the 2:1 sampling change, capture it in the backlog, and refocus on Santander work.
- Key steps:
  1. Restored the BRFSS loader and Census sample builder to their original 50/50 (1:1) behavior and reverted the README messaging accordingly.
  2. Added a backlog bullet in `docs/iteration_plan.md` noting the future 2:1 downsampling task so it doesn’t get lost.
  3. Reran `pytest` as a sanity check before moving back to the Santander effort.
