- Task: Execute the new BRFSS frontier config to produce a richer set of diabetes feature sets.
- Key steps:
  1. Attempted to run `python -m fs_xgb.cli.main --config fs_xgb/experiments/configs/brfss_2015_frontier.yaml --results-dir results` twice (2 min and 4 min timeouts); both runs exceeded the allowed runtime before finishing.
  2. Temporarily experimented with lighter training parameters to speed things up but reverted to the previous config after confirming the run still exceeded the timeout.
  3. Documented that no new results were produced and outlined options (longer runtime, fewer max candidates, or smaller n_estimators) for the human to run locally.
