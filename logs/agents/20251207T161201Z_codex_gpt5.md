- Task: Downsample all constructed samples to a 2:1 majority/minority ratio for downstream analysis.
- Key steps:
  1. Updated the BRFSS loader to cap the majority class at twice the minority count (deterministic RNG) and refreshed README/iteration-plan text describing the ratio.
  2. Reworked `scripts/create_census_balanced_sample.py` to emit a 2:1 downsampled split (docstrings, CLI help, error handling) while keeping the existing interface/path defaults.
  3. Ran `pytest` to ensure the adjustments didn’t introduce regressions.
