- Start: 2025-12-07T03:15:00Z

- Task: Read the codebase to understand the project scope before receiving the concrete request.
- Key steps:
  1. Reviewed the README, PRD, and iteration roadmap to capture goals, supported datasets, and the multi-iteration plan.
  2. Skimmed repo instructions in `agents.md` to note mandatory logging/reporting practices.
  3. Inspected the core pipeline (`fs_xgb/pipeline.py`), feature-selection logic (`fs_xgb/fs_logic/fs_pipeline.py`), preprocessing stack, metrics, and dataset registry/loaders to understand how experiments are orchestrated end-to-end.
