- Task: Kick off the first Santander Customer Satisfaction experiment run.
- Key steps:
  1. Downloaded/unzipped the Kaggle competition files into `data/raw/santander_customer_satisfaction/` per the README instructions.
  2. Fixed a syntax regression in `fs_xgb/eval/reporting.py` so report generation works again.
  3. Ran `python -m fs_xgb.cli.main --config fs_xgb/experiments/configs/santander_customer_satisfaction.yaml --results-dir results`, producing `results/santander_customer_satisfaction/20251207T161746Z`, and re-ran `pytest` for safety.
