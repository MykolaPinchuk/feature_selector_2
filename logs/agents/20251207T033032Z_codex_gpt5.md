- Task: Add a richer frontier sweep configuration for the BRFSS diabetes dataset and document how to run it.
- Key steps:
  1. Reviewed the existing BRFSS experiment config plus other frontier templates to decide on a wider grid of thresholds and rest-policy variants.
  2. Created `fs_xgb/experiments/configs/brfss_2015_frontier.yaml` with the expanded grid, SHAP/gain overfit filters, and a higher candidate cap.
  3. Updated the README frontier instructions to mention the new BRFSS frontier config so users can invoke the broader sweep.
