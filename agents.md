# Global Instructions (Baseline)

- Do not go outside this repo. Do not delete or edit any files outside this workspace!
- Even if you have mistakely or unintentionally created a file or a folder outside this repo, do not edit or delete it w/o asking permission. In such cases stop your work and ask human for a permission to delete them.
- Use rapid iteration. Start with a simple version that works, then add features incrementally. When dealing with large tasks, proceed in small increments and validate key assumptions/results for each increment before proceeding further. Validate assumptions quickly. Then add complexity incrementally.
- Do not run any code which is expected to take more than 5 minutes to run. Use timeouts. Use 2 minutes as default timeout for any code execution.
- Run code to verify behavior. Do not rely on assumptions or placeholders.
- When in doubt, err on the side of not overengineering.
- Never replace user-provided values with placeholders.
- When code fails repeatedly, capture detailed step-by-step logs and investigate.
- Do not touch git except for .gitignore. Human will handle git workflow. Make sure that large files are added to .gitignore.
- You can use all except one vCPUs/threads available at this machine.
- Use logs/agents/ dir to store any logs related to agent runs. After completing each task/iteration, summarize the key steps taken by the agent and store them in a markdown file in the agent_logs dir. Specify which agent and model were used as well as exact timestamps.

# DS Dev Profile

- If you need to build ML models, prefer XGBoost to RF. RF is much slower while its performance is slightly worse than that of XGBoost. In general, prefer 1. XGBoost and 2. LightGBM over any other type of model.
- Always do at least basic EDA and save its results.
- When doing modeling, think about what target variable is and what features are. Think about what they actually mean. Do not just blindly apply models without understanding the data.
- When doing modeling, always split data into at least three sets (train, validation, test). Always report results on all three sets.
- Iterate rapidly. Start with small subsamples. When scaling up to full data, estimate how long code will take to run. Avoid any code that is expected to take more than 5 minutes to run.
- Use multiprocessing to speed up code if needed.
- For each dataset/modeling problem, create a eda_summary.md. It should contain:
  - description of the dataset/problem. It should describe which problem modeling task will try to solve, what target variable means, what key features are, and what they mean.
  - basic EDA results (distributions of key variables, missingness, correlations).
  If the task includes building and evaluating a model, such information may be included into model_summary.md instead of eda_summary.md. What amtters is that any run should have at least one of these two files describing the data.
- When reporting a subtask as complete, clearly specify where the main results/reports which human will likely want to see are located.

# Repo-Specific Instructions Template

- Results and logs directories contain history and outputs from many runs. Reading all of them will consume a lot of context. Thus an agent should avoid reading such results/logs from old runs unless there is a strong reason to read them. By default, look only at the most recent run if needed.
